=head1 NAME

XT::Files::Plugin::Dirs - plugin to add directories to be tested

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.002

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In the L<XT::Files> config file:

    [Dirs]
    bin = bin
    bin = script
    module = lib
    test = t
    test = xt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Adds some directories to L<XT::Files> to be tested by author tests. Every
file found in the directory that matches the directory types criteria,
is added, as the specified type.

The files are searched recursive. Symlinks are skipped.

The directories are sorted and processed in reverse order. This allows you to
e.g. add

    bin = maint
    module = maint/lib

and F<maint/lib> will be searched first. Then, when F<maint> is searched all
the files found from F<maint/lib> won't be overwritten, effectively blocking
them from being found as bin.

The following options are supported:

=over 4

=item * bin

Adds all files contained in these directories as Perl scripts to the list of
files to be tested.

=item * module

Adds all files with the C<.pm> extension, contained in these directories, as
module files to the list of files to be tested. Files with the C<.pod>
extension are added as Pod files.

=item * test

Adds all files contained in these directories with the C<.t> extension as
test files.
